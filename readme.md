# Simple Handwriting Recognition Demo

Quick and simple little demo for how to use a pre-configured classifier to analyze handwriting samples. Most of the juicy stuff is in the .ipynb file, so you should look at that for an explanation of how it works and stuff.

If you'd actually like to run it, you'll need to have a working installation of iPython (Jupyter?) Notebook, and `numpy`/`scikit-learn`/`matplotlib` installed. I reccomend using either `pip` or `conda` for that.
